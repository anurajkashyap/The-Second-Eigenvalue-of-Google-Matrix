# The-Second-Eigenvalue-of-Google-Matrix
We analyze the PageRank algorithm used by Google to rank web pages, using math to derive a formula for the second largest eigenvalue of the web graph matrix. We show its relation to the algorithm's convergence rate, stability, accuracy, and susceptibility to manipulation. This provides insights into an important algorithm in information retrieval.
